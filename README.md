## 🧪 Testing

### Backend Testing with Pest & PHPUnit ✅

The project uses **Pest** (modern PHP testing framework) alongside PHPUnit for comprehensive testing coverage. **All tests are now passing consistently!**

#### 🎯 Pest Testing Framework
- **Pest 4.x** installed with PHPUnit 12.x
- **23 comprehensive tests** covering User, Campaign, and API functionality
- **Clean, readable syntax** that makes tests more maintainable
- **Powerful expectations** with `expect()` assertions

#### 🚀 Running Tests with Make Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test suites
make test-unit          # Unit tests only
make test-feature       # Feature tests only

# Run Pest tests (recommended) - Native Pest execution
make test-pest          # All Pest tests
make test-pest-unit     # Pest unit tests only
make test-pest-feature  # Pest feature tests only
make test-pest-api      # Pest API tests only

# Run specific tests
make test-filter filter="UserTest"           # Filter by test name
make test-pest-filter filter="UserTest"      # Filter Pest tests by name
make test-pest-file file="UserTest.php"      # Run specific Pest test file
```

**Note**: Pest tests now run natively! The configuration conflict has been resolved and all tests execute directly through the Pest framework.

#### 📊 Test Coverage

**User Model Tests (7 tests)**
- User creation and updates
- Email validation and uniqueness
- Admin privileges and employee details
- Field validation and formatting

**Campaign Model Tests (8 tests)**
- Campaign creation and management
- Progress calculations and status management
- Relationships (user, category)
- Featured campaigns and date casting

**Campaign API Tests (8 tests)**
- CRUD operations
- Authentication requirements
- Authorization checks
- Validation rules and database assertions

#### 🔧 Test Configuration

- **Database**: PostgreSQL test database (`acme_csr_test`)
- **Environment**: Isolated testing environment
- **Factories**: Comprehensive model factories for test data
- **Seeders**: Campaign categories and sample data

#### 📝 Writing New Tests

**Pest Syntax (Recommended):**
```php
test('user can be created with required fields', function () {
    $user = User::factory()->create([
        'name' => 'John Doe',
        'email' => 'john@example.com',
    ]);

    expect($user->name)->toBe('John Doe');
    expect($user->email)->toBe('john@example.com');
    expect($user->id)->not->toBeNull();
});
```

**Traditional PHPUnit Syntax:**
```php
class UserTest extends TestCase
{
    #[Test]
    public function it_can_create_a_user(): void
    {
        $user = User::factory()->create();
        $this->assertEquals('John Doe', $user->name);
    }
}
```

#### 🎉 Test Results
- **All 23 Pest tests pass** when run in Docker environment
- **Tests demonstrate Pest's elegance** and power
- **Foundation ready** for future Pest integration
- **Comprehensive coverage** of core functionality

#### 🎉 Current Pest Status
